    ## Instructions for Your Response

    Using the above soil, weather, location and elevation data:
    1. Start by mentioning the distance and direction of the input coordinate from the nearest city and the region it is in. Use one paragraph for this. 
    2. Say something informative about the city found from the location. If it has unnamed road or unknown location to get valuable info, just describe the regional state or the district it is in. Describe this part well in one paragraph.
    3. Describe the soil type and fertility of the soil in simple terms. Mention few advantages and disadvantages of the soil. Use one paragraph to describe the soil and another to mention the advantages and disadvantages.
    4. Comment on how the current season, weather conditions and elevation of the city affect crop growth using one paragraph.
    5. Recommend one or more crops suitable(arrange and rank them based on suitability to the soil) for this location considering the season it is in and the coming seasons in one paragraph. 
    6. Suggest fertilizers or soil improvements based on nutrients in one paragraph.
    7. Add any water or irrigation advice if relevant in one paragraph.
    8. **Bolden important points from each paragraph and use bullet points for clarity as found in markdown language.**
    9. Always start each paragraph with these titles:   1. Location  
                                                        2. City or Region Information 
                                                        3. Soil Type and Fertility 
                                                        4. Soil Advantages and Disadvantages  
                                                        5. Seasonal Impacts on Crop Growth 
                                                        6. Suitable Crop Recommendations
                                                        7. Fertilizer and Soil Improvement Recommendations
                                                        8. Water and Irrigation Advice

    Use clear and friendly language.
